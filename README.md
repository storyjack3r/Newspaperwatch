Newspaper watching bot
===================================



Twitter bot made to run using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) and the [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) node.js library.

You can find more [tutorials](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/twitterbots/#tutorials-nodejs) and [open source Twitter bots](https://botwiki.org/tag/twitter+bot+opensource+nodejs/) on [Botwiki](https://botwiki.org).

And be sure to join the [Botmakers](https://botmakers.org/) online hangout and [submit your bot to Botwiki](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot) :-)


## Note on bots that auto-reply to DMs/@ mentions

Apps hosted on Glitch are automatically put to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity (that is, if nobody opens your app in a browser window or it doesn't receive any data).

Twitter's API doesn't send requests to your app, instead your app has to poll Twitter for data. 

See [this Glitch starter project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/twitterbot-autorespond) where i work around this limitation and make a Twitter bot that responds to DMs and @ mentions (with a [25 minute delay](https://support.glitch.com/t/a-simple-twitter-bot-template/747/16)).
